# Test Module 2 (HTML and CSS) 
## Structure
For this website I will use semantic code to maintain all organized and keep good "manners" while coding(Something like clean code)

## Here you can see the layout of how the website would look in both perspectives

(Please ignore those sections in the phone image)

## Instructions
As you can see in both images there is a main header that is always in the same position to maintain the user experience, the website is simple but it meets the requirements of being user-friendly.

You can always see the main header in every "page" of the website.

Now I invite you to explore the page that I made for this test(Please don't judge me I was quite stressed while doing it, I don't know why I have this fear for tests hehe.
